# Test Coverage

Test coverage is the percentage of lines of code that are executed during all of the tests. High test coverage gives you confidence that a large amount of code executed during the tests. In turn, the more lines of code executed through tests, the more confident you can be that the code works as expected.

## Instructions

In this lab we are going learn how to improve your test coverage by reading the missing lines report and then writing test cases to cover those lines.
